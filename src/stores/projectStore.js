//Juno Observer Description Markdown 
const joDescMD = `
Junocam is an instrument onboard NASA's [Juno spacecraft](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/juno/), which is currently orbiting Jupiter and sending back new imagery every month
and a half as it reaches 'perijove' - it's closest point to the planet. I've written my own processing pipeline for this [image data](https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/junocam/processing)
(which I'll soon be re-writing, open-sourcing, and documenting here), and Juno Observer is my way of displaying the results.

It allows you to browse all of the available perijove data, projected onto a 3D representation of Jupiter, giving context to the imagery
in a way that wasn't previously possible.

The live app uses imagery from the original version of my processing pipeline, which has since vastly improved. I'm also currently about
75% of the way through a complete re-write of the app, which already contains a lot more features, thanks to the fact that is now uses
the same base structure as [AreoBrowser](./projects/areo-browser).
