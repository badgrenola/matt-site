//Areo Description Markdown
const areoDescMD = `
Areo is a custom Mac app designed for opening, viewing and converting Digital Terrain Models in the _.IMG_ format. 

The released version (available above) was designed specifically to quickly open .IMG files generated from [HiRISE](https://www.uahirise.org/dtm/) imagery, 
and convert them into .OBJ files at a given proxy level (_1/2, 1/4, 1/8_ etc.).
It also includes the ability to generate 3D-printable versions of these models.

It was originally created as part of a month-long project I set myself, to see if I could both understand the data structure, and 
create a tool that not only opens the files quickly, but also converts them into a useful, more-accessible 3D format.

I have been working on a newer version of this app which expands the amount of file formats, and implements a command-line version
of the featureset. This new version currently forms part of my [Areo Browser](./projects/areo-browser) data pipeline, and I plan on
documenting and releasing it here in the near future.

//Juno Observer Description Markdown 
const joDescMD = `
Junocam is an instrument onboard NASA's [Juno spacecraft](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/juno/), which is currently orbiting Jupiter and sending back new imagery every month
and a half as it reaches 'perijove' - it's closest point to the planet. I've written my own processing pipeline for this [image data](https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/junocam/processing)
(which I'll soon be re-writing, open-sourcing, and documenting here), and Juno Observer (a [React](https://reactjs.org/)/[ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/) web-app) is my way of displaying the results.

It allows you to browse all of the available perijove data, projected onto a 3D representation of Jupiter, giving context to the imagery
in a way that wasn't previously possible.

The live version of the app uses imagery from the original version of my processing pipeline, which has since vastly improved. I'm also currently about
75% of the way through a complete re-write of the app, which already contains a lot more features, thanks to the fact that is now uses
the same base structure as [AreoBrowser](./projects/areo-browser).

//Areo Browser Description Markdown 
const abDescMD = `
Areo Browser is a [React](https://reactjs.org/)/[ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/) web-app that allows you to explore nearly 2000 Martian terrain models, in full 3D, directly in your browser and on mobile. 
It currently uses data from both the [HiRISE](https://www.uahirise.org/) camera (on-board NASA's [Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter](https://mars.nasa.gov/mro/)), and the [HRSC](https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2004/01/The_High_Resolution_Stereo_Camera_HRSC) (on-board ESA's [Mars Express](http://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Mars_Express)).

With options for mesh and image resolution, vertical exaggeration, and displaying a custom [Cividis](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0199239) gradient with contour mapping on the model,
Areo Browser vastly increases the accessibility of the included data.

This new version of Areo Browser is able to process and view all types of Martian 3D data, so if you'd like to talk about having your data included, [please just get in touch!](mailto:hello@mattbrealey.com)

Each available model consists of two parts - the mesh, and the associated image data.

The mesh is generated on-the-fly in the browser, using [Web Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers) to convert a custom-encoded RGB image into the required height data.
This custom image format is an order-of-magnitude smaller than the original source file, but maintains a high-level of accuracy, and allows different resolutions to be quickly generated as needed.
It is created using an upcoming new version of my Mac-based conversion tool, [Areo](./projects/areo).

Two images are then applied to the model. The first is a colour image, created by combining all available RGB image data from the source files, and displayed at the desired resolution.
The second is a _normal_ map, which is a way of adding extra perceived detail to the model, without needing to increase the poly-count, again helping to ensure that the files can be viewed on older devices.
